                                     <p>Over the past decades, Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is employed to meet specific system requirements. A wide variety and small volume are the advantages of ASIC. However, the diversity of applications contradicts the high investment in ASIC R&D while process technology going to 1Xnm. To realize an ASIC corresponding to the application in a low-cost way, a hardware scheme with the same topology as the C/C++ description should be the most direct implementation and the most efficient as well. Reconfigurable chip is both software and hardware programable. The hardware architecture and functions change dynamically in real-time with the change of software algorithm while ensuring flexibility. Thus it is also called a software-defined chip. The wide adaptability of the software-defined chip makes it a strong competitor to replace ASIC, FPGA, and general-purpose processors.</p>
                                     <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous and AI chip has become a research hotspot in recent years. AI algorithms vary in different applications and will continue to evolve. AI services are migrating from cloud to edge nowadays. Performance demands and power consumption constraints require AI to deployed on an energy-efficient computing engine. Reconfigurable architecture is the ideal solution for intelligent computing since its programmability and dynamic reconfigurability of architecture can adapt algorithm evolution and diversity of applications and greatly improves energy efficiency as well.</p>
                                     <p>Dynamically reconfigurable technology brings the ability to bear the diversity and evolution of AI algorithms. Software-defined AI chips are expected to provide a new route for China's chip technology to get rid of imitation.</p>

                                     <p>This presentation will highlight some of the emerging challenges and opportunities for sub-5nm process machine learning and AI technologies in the rapidly evolving IoT industry. With Moore’s law process technology scaling well into the nano-scale regime, future SoC platforms ranging from high performance cloud servers to ultra-low-power edge devices will demand advanced AI capabilities and energy-efficient deep neural networks. New and emerging IoT markets for autonomous vehicles, drones, and wearables require even higher performance at much lower cost while reducing energy consumption. Some of the prominent barriers to designing high performance and energy-efficient AI processors and SoCs in the sub-5nm technology nodes will be outlined. New paradigm shifts necessary for integrating special-purpose machine learning accelerators into next-generation SoCs will be explored. Emerging trends in SoC circuit design for machine learning and deep neural networks, specialized accelerators for in-memory and near-memory computing, reconfigurable multi-precision matrix multipliers, ultra-low-voltage logic, memory and clocking circuits, AI inference accelerators including binary neural networks and associated on-chip interconnect fabric circuits are described. Future brain-inspired neuromorphic computing circuit design challenges and technologies will also be reviewed. Specific chip design examples and case studies supported by silicon measurements and trade-offs will be discussed.

                                     <p>Augmented reality (AR) is a set of technologies that will fundamentally change the way we interact with our environment. It represents a merging of the physical and the digital worlds into a rich, context aware user interface delivered through a socially acceptable form factor such as eyeglasses. The majority of these novel experiences in AR systems will be powered by AI because of their superior ability to handle in-the-wild scenarios. In this presentation, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities in enabling AI-based algorithms in an energy-constrained AR system. One key AR use case is a personalized, proactive and context-aware Assistant that can understand the user’s activity and their environment using audio-visual understanding. In this presentation, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities in both training and deployment of efficient audio-visual understanding on AR glasses. We show why it is imperative to co-design and co-optimize the AI algorithms and the hardware platforms jointly. We will present our early work to demonstrate the benefits and potential of such a co-design approach and discuss open research areas that are promising for the research community to explore.

IoVT will become more important as the numbers of cameras and applications are growing exponentially in the coming years. Humans cannot process all the videos and it is critical to use artificial intelligence (AI) to process the data. Many challenges arise fulfilling the era of IoVT, e.g., accuracy, energy efficiency, processing speed.
